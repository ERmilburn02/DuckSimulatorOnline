# Privacy Policy

## The Games

The only information that is ever stored on our servers from your game
is your fastest speedrun time, and it is only stored if you elect to
use our Discord connection method. All other information is stored
locally on your device for peace of mind, and we will never give or
sell this information to a third-party.

## The Discord Bot

By using the Duck Simulator Discord server, our custom-coded bot will
store some of your Discord details (specifically your User ID,
username and tag, and profile picture). These are used for connecting
your Discord account to the games, saving your position on our server
leaderboard, and a contact method of your choice if you decide to
utilize the /setcontact command. We will never give or sell this
information to a third-party.

## TL;DR: We will NEVER share your information!
