        Duck Simulator 2 is a game about quacking a rubber duck. Seems simple
        enough, right?
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, the game begins to break and the developer is left with no
        choice but to create several temporary games.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game includes four genres in the campaign, a remastered version of
        the first game, and more!
      </p>

      <p>
        Duck Simulator 2 is currently available to download for free on XBOX and
        Steam!
